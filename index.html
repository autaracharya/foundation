            <h2>Nepal</h2>
            <p id="para1">Nepal, often referred to as the "Roof of the World," is a country that embodies unparalleled
                natural
                beauty and cultural richness. Nestled in the heart of the Himalayas, Nepal boasts some of the
                world's
                highest peaks, including the majestic Mount Everest. The country's diverse topography ranges from
                snow-capped mountains to lush valleys, offering breathtaking landscapes at every turn. Travelers are
                enchanted by the pristine beauty of its Himalayan landscapes, where towering peaks pierce the clear
                blue
                skies, and terraced fields painted in vibrant green cascade down the hillsides. The serene lakes,
                such
                as Phewa Lake in Pokhara and Rara Lake in the remote far-western region, add to Nepal's enchantment.
                Beyond its stunning landscapes, Nepal's rich cultural heritage, with its ancient temples,
                monasteries,
                and warm-hearted people, makes it a destination that not only pleases the eyes but also nourishes
